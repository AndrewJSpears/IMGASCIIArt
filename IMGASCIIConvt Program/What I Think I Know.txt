What I Think I know...

Interface.
	- File Input
	- Output File Name (During image selection process)
	Possible additional features... Grayscale/color etc... 

What do I think I know the program needs to do?
	1. Take in an image
	2. Convert pixels to greyscale image (save this file?)
	3. Convert pixels based on color range to ascii (index? carrage 		return for new line?)
	4. Write array to text file.

Need documentation
